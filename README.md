## About This Project

This project is to help minecrafters convert some of their oldest worlds to a version of the game that they can update to the newest version
by the game its self with out having to do anything tricky with MCEdit.

Currently this program can only be ran in a IDE as I have not added a UI yet once the base function of the program is complete I will add that.

This Project Uses [Simple-NBT](https://github.com/BJTMastermind/simple-nbt) to read and write files.
