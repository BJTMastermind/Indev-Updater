## About This Project

This project is to help minecrafters convert some of their oldest worlds to a version of the game that they can update to the newest version
by the game its self with out having to do anything tricky with MCEdit.

Currently this program can only be ran/compiled to a jar in a IDE where you can use the UI. Once I finish the block/skylight conversions I will release the pre-compiled jar file in a pre-release.

This Project Uses [Simple-NBT](https://github.com/BJTMastermind/simple-nbt) to read and write files.
